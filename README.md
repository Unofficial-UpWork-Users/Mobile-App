## Rules:

1. Don't expect anyone from UpWork to read anything written here. You're sharing for informational purposes with other UpWork users.

2. Do feel free to comment on other people rasised issue.

3. UpWork users are this placing jobs/contracts on the platform, and those bidding for jobs/contracts towards executing them and recieving payment for that.

4. Language here should be "high esteem" as far as possible. Be nice when writing about UpWork staff and corporate. Talk about things that would be "even better if", and not in a "this sucks" style (which is negative). Yes, this is an arbitrary rule, but we don't want to make this a hostile place for UpWork themselves.
